# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the project ws to help Pewlett Hackard determine the number of exisiting retiring employees and identify
current employees who would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The company has a large amount of employees
who will be retiring and the purpose of the mentorship program would be to train and transition eligible employees into
some of the to-be vacant positions.  

## Results:
- Results for the retiring employees were quite alarming. As you can see below, roughly 70% of senior employees will be eligible
for retirement. These employees have a skillset that is valuable to the organization and it will take some time to replace
these individuals. It is great that the organization is starting the mentorship program to hopefully a good number of mid-level
staff into these roles. 
- The remaining 30% who are retiring should not be as hard to replace as these will be entry level or mid level positions and far
far less in number than the senior roles.
#### Retiring Employees Table

- The table below is a snapshot of the mentoship eligibility we pulled for Pewlett Hackard. Although it is great to have this
information, there are only 1549 who are eligible for mentorship. The organization should either expand its eligibilty
criteria to include more employees, or begin planning for a focused recruitment effort to fill the vacancies. The number
employees elibible for mentorship will not fill the 70% gap the organization will be facing soon.
- Perhaps Pewlett Hackard could also create packages that allow some very specialized senior positions to remain employed
part-time or as consultants for a period of time while the company continues to recruit for the open positions. It is
such a large group to leave at once and the organization does need to explore options to retain a group of these employees
longer if needed.

## Summary:
In addition to the suggestions above, Pewlett Hackard may also want to look into which departments the Senior Staff and Senior
Engineers belong to. This way they can focus the most recruitment/mentorship resources on the departments with the most senior
employees who will be retiring. This would be relatively easy to pull from our databases. Another key piece of information would
be the total salaries by employees and by title. The organization definitely needs to determine if salary ranges need to be
increased to be competitive with the market. Some positions may need salaries reduced as well. Overall, knowing the market rates
and existing budget will be important to recruit top candidates.
